# Introduction

Welcome to the LocalStack API documentation! LocalStack is a local business search application which uses social media to provide relavant and interesting results. The API is RESTful and enables adding, updating or delete business listing data on [LocalStack.com](http://LocalStack.com) and it's properties. The API also allows you to check the status and map your business data to our database as well as retrieve all your business listings within our system.

Sample code is currently available as cURL in the dark area to the right. Requests and responses are all in JSON.

The API base url is: **https://api.localstack.com/api/v1/**

The API is versioned, the current version is 1. This is designated in the url path with /v1

If you have any question please visit [our support pages](http://support.localstack.com).


# Authentication

> To set authorization, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl https://api.localstack.com/api/v1/status
  -H "Authorization: Token token=YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN"
```

> Make sure to replace `YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN` with your API access key.

LocalStack uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can get an account by contacting us.

The LocalStack API expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server. The API key can be passed either as a parameter like the following:

`access_token=YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN`

Or in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Token token=YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN` with your API key.

# Getting Started Workflow

There are many ways and uses for the API. Here are the major typical workflows:

1) [Find Right Category ID](#get-categories-in-json) - You'll first want to grab a list of our category ID's before getting started.

2) [Search for listings](#get-a-search-for-listings-in-json) - We recommend when searching using: Name, Address, Latitude, Longitude and Phone number.

3) [Get a listing detail](#get-a-listing) - Verify the listings status and make sure that it is Available to be claimed.

4) [Post partner listings](#post-a-new-partner-listing) - Push all your listings into our database with your listing ID and the Mojo_ID of the listing you want to claim ownership for.

4.A) [Post a suppress listing](#post-suppress-a-listing) - If there are duplicates or other issues with listings in our database then supress them.

4.B) [Add a partner listing](#post-a-new-partner-listing) - If you have verified there is no match to a search result, Post a partner listing without a Mojo_ID and it will be added.

4.C) [Update partner listing](#update-a-partner-listing) - If you have claimed a listing and the status is active then you can update it at anytime and any parameters passed will be updated.

5) [Get partner listings](#get-partner-listings-in-json) - Lastly this will give you all your listings and the status of those listins in our database.
